<br><p>It was in 1964 that G. Rajendran founded GRT Jewellers, in the fast-growing shopping hub of Chennai (formerly Madras).
Like all great success stories, GRT as the shop is fondly called by customers, began from humble origins.
Through single-minded focus on customer satisfaction, GRT soon became a household name in Chennai, gaining renown for the purity of its ornaments, wide choice of designs and consistent customer delight.<br>
<br><b>growing confidence<br></b>
<br><br>GRT's growing customer base made necessary the expansion of its retail outlet. A bigger showroom was built to give customers a great shopping ambience, as well as the widest choice of collections. Silverware had its own separate floor, which boasted of the largest collection in India on a single floor.
Subsequently, a new showroom was added on Coats Road, T Nagar, Chennai, reflecting changing tastes and needs of customers. This showroom also boasts of the largest diamond floor in Chennai.<br><br>
<br><b>GRT silversmith and oriena</b><br>
<br><br>GRT Silversmith' is an exclusive silver jewellery collection introduced by GRT Jewellers. The overwhelming response to this collection called for a separate showroom of its own, housed at Chennai next to GRT Jewellery Saving Scheme Section and shop-in-shops across all its branches.
